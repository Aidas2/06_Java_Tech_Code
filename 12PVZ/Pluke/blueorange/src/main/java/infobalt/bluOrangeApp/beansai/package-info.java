/**
 * This package should hold controller classes, or "backing beans" in JSF terms.
 * These classes are responsible for managing user-interface logic like:
 * showing and hiding items, displaying forms, handling navigation, displaying messages.
 * However, they strictly cannot hold any business logic!
 * 
 * Business logic must be in Entities (if logic is specific to single entity)
 * or Services package if logic overlaps several entities.
 * 
 * Those classes should not do anything else!
